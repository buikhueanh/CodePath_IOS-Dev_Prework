**App Idea**
**App Name: DeCarpool**

**Description:**

DeCarpool is a carpooling app designed specifically for college campuses to connect students who need transportation with those who have cars. The app fosters a sense of community and reduces environmental impact by promoting ride-sharing.

**Key Features:**

*Ride Posting and Requests:* Students can post available rides or request a carpool to specific locations. Each post includes details such as departure time, destination, and number of seats available.
*Verification and Safety:* Drivers must verify their identity with a student ID and driverâ€™s license. Riders and drivers can rate and review each other for safety and accountability.
*In-App Communication:* A secure chat feature allows users to communicate and finalize trip details without sharing personal phone numbers.
*Cost Splitting:* Integrated payment options allow passengers to split the cost of the ride fairly, based on distance or a flat rate.
*Campus Integration:* Includes campus maps, event-based carpool suggestions, and notifications for ride matches near specific buildings or events.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented required features:
